I am a Cybersecurity professional skilled in application security, cloud security and automation using tools and languages, such as python, javascript, bash, AWS, Burp Suite, and many more. I have dabbled in other areas of tech including embedded systems and deep learning, participated in bug bounty programs, vulnerability disclosure programs, and code reviews.

I love to play games (mostly FPS games and FIFA), watch movies, cook and play around with various web applications. It's great to break things so they can be built stronger.
